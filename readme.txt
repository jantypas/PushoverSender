PushoverSender is a simple command line program to send messages through the Pushover service.
Written it go, it can be used in Linux scripts, ansimble etc.  It's similar to what could be done with
curl, but a bit more flexible.

It comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind and I plan to deny I ever wrote such a thing :-)
Use it if you must, but remember I had nothing to do with any of it!!! :-)
I was no where near the keyboard at the time!

Update the pushover.conf.json file to whatever you choose and place it in
/etc with read permissions for the binary.
